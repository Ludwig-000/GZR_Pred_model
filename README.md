GZR Prediction Model-  A self made LLM based on "Mysteries Of Immortal Puppet Master".

How to run:

1) Install PyTorch via pip
2) run generate_text.py in a console

- Settings:
The model is pretrained, and i am still adjusting stuff, so for now the only adjustable metrics are on line 52 of the script 
( length of the generated text and the temperature )

:)
